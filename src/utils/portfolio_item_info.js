          It allows a user to complete most of the forms required by stepping
          through a series of questions and then determining if there are any

          downloaded as .docx, or faxed.

          separate access schedule for each child or one schedule for all
          children, as well as an admin section allowing an admin user to log in
          as another user, set a banner notification for all users, email all
